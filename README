DNS.com API module for integration with CPanel

DEPENDENCIES
----------------------
These modules must be compiled, then copy the contents of blib/lib to the /usr/local/cpanel/perl directory.

URI
LWP
JSON
attributes.pm
Crypt::SSLeay (for SSL. This will only work with the live site and not the sandbox.)

Precompiled version of all of these are located in the perl directory, but you may still have to compile them yourself.



INSTALLATION
----------------------
-Copy DnsDotComManager.pm to /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/

-Copy dns_com to /usr/local/cpanel/base/frontend/x3/

-Make a directory at /var/local/dnsdotcom and set the permissions so the cpanel user has write access. This is where individual users auth tokens will be stored.

-In the DnsDotComManager.pm you must change the hostname to your desired host for API usage. IE sandbox.dns.com or for live dns www.dns.com

-Install the dns_com.cpanelplugin file as per these instructions.
    http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/AutomationIntegration/InstallingPlugins

-Once installed you will need to get your AUTH_TOKEN from the dns.com control panel and set it up in your manager.
